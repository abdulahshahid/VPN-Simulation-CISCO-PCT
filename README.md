## Project Overview
In today's digitally connected world, network security is a fundamental requirement. This project aims to simulate a secure remote access infrastructure by creating a VPN with Cisco Packet Tracer. It emphasizes the role of Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) in achieving encryption, integrity, and authenticity of data.

Key goals include:
- Configuring VPN gateways.
- Establishing secure communication channels.
- Implementing and analyzing IPsec protocols.

---

## Features and Objectives
- **Secure Communication**: Implementation of IPsec protocols, including Authentication Header (AH) and Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP).
- **Encryption Techniques**: Use of AES-based encryption for securing data transmissions.
- **ISAKMP Policies**: Configuration of ISAKMP for key exchange and secure tunnel establishment.
- **Real-time Simulations**: Testing various VPN scenarios in Cisco Packet Tracer.
- **Performance Optimization**: Balancing security measures with resource utilization.

## Implementation Details
1. **ISAKMP Policy Configuration**: Setting up encryption and authentication algorithms for secure communication.
2. **IPsec Transform Sets**: Defining encryption and hashing mechanisms to ensure data confidentiality and integrity.
3. **Access Lists**: Specifying network traffic that requires encryption or bypasses the VPN tunnel.
4. **Crypto Maps**: Binding ISAKMP policies, transform sets, and access lists to router interfaces.
5. **Testing and Verification**:
   - Displaying active IKE and IPsec security associations.
   - Inspecting configured ISAKMP policies and crypto maps.

Commands used for verification include:
- `show crypto isakmp sa`
- `show crypto isakmp policy`
- `show crypto map`
- `show crypto ipsec sa`

## Challenges Faced
- **Resource Constraints**: High resource requirements of IPsec protocols affected system performance.
- **Optimization**: Ensuring robust security without compromising efficiency in simulations.
- **Configuration Errors**: Addressing misconfigurations to establish seamless VPN connections.
